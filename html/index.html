                For the past 10 years, Simmons Hall has hosted a team for the MIT Mystery Hunt, a quintessential
                MIT tradition. For those unfamiliar with puzzle hunts, check out the official Mystery Hunt Website:
                <a href="http://web.mit.edu/puzzle" target="_blank">web.mit.edu/puzzle</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We welcome all residents, alumni and friends of Simmons Hall, experienced and novice. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The hunt starts on <b>Friday January 17, 2014 at 12 noon</b> and usually lasts until 
                Sunday evening (or whenever the coin is found).
    
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>You can join the hunt at any time</b> --  stop by Simmons dining any time during the weekend 
                and we'll bring you up to speed and help get you started with the puzzles.

            <h2 id ="teaminfo">Hunt/Team Information</h2>
            
            <h4>Headquarters</h4>
            <p>
                Our team headquarters will be in 
                <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=229+vassar+st+cambridge+ma" target="_blank">
                    Simmons Dining, 229 Vassar St, Cambridge, MA.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                We will be trying to organize some quiet space (second floor party room) and showers 
                for those visiting from out of town to nap/rest/clean up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to stricter dorm security procedures we will need to confirm/gather names of non-Simmons residents 
                who need access to the building - watch for another email the week before the hunt begins.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Food / Snacks</h4>
            <p>
                We'll have two dinners Friday and Saturday nights and assorted breakfasts/snacks/beverages/etc. 
                throughout the hunt for team participants. You won't go hungry!
            </p>
            
            <h4>Funding / Contributions</h4>
            <p>
                Simmons Hall house government has approved a funding proposal for the weekend. 
                This is intended to support resident participation on the team and cover much but not all of the expenses for the weekend. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We are encouraging people (particularly nonresidents) to contribute a small amount 
                (suggested donation ~$20 or ~$5 / meal etc.) towards the food budget to enable us to cater team-wide food options.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any excess funds left over beyond actual food expenses will be donated to Simmons's general fund 
                through the Simons Hall Sponge Fund. A complete budget / expense report will be available after the hunt.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Materials / Equipment</h4>
            <p>
                We will have a number of materials available such as paper / pens / markers / scissors / printer / etc. 
                If you have other favorite hunt supplies, etc. feel free to bring them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please <b>bring your computer</b> (if possible). The puzzles are distributed via the hunt website
                and many of them encourage and require you to use a computer. We will use Google Docs/Drive to manage
                working puzzle documents.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Organization / Setup</h4>
            <p>
                We will begin setting up for the weekend on <b>Friday morning, Jan 17.</b>
                If you're free, please join us in Simmons Dining starting around <b>10am</b> to help get headquarters set up.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you'd like to help organize food/logistics, etc. send us an email at simhunt-org@mit.edu
            </p>
            
            <h4>Hunt Kickoff</h4>
            <p>
                The hunt begins at <b>12 noon on Friday, Jan 17</b> with a kickoff in Kresge Auditorium. 
                It usually involves a skit that introduces the year's theme. The first round of puzzles are released shortly after it ends.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you'd like to join us to go to the kickoff as a group, we'll meet in <b>Simmons Dining at 11:30am.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have conflicts and can't make it to the kickoff, don't worry! 
                You can join the hunt at any time --  stop by Simmons dining any time during the weekend 
                and we'll bring you up to speed and help get you started with the puzzles.
    
            </p>
            
            <h4>End of Hunt Wrap-up</h4>
            <p>
                The hunt officially ends when a team finds the coin. Quoting the organizers:
            </p>
            <p class="quot">
                "Regardless of when the first team finds the coin, HQ will stay open accepting puzzle answer submissions 
                until at least 6 pm on Sunday. Wrap up will be no later than 12 pm on Monday."
            </p>        
            <p>
                Again, we will organize a group to attend the wrap-up presentation together. Details will be announced during the hunt.
            </p>
